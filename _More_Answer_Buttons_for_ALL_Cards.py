WARNING: this addon uses private methods to achieve its goals. Use at your
    own risk and keep backups.

What it does: Adds anywhere between 1 to 4 new buttons to the review window
    when reviewing a new card. The new buttons function like the existing "Easy"
    button, but in addition, they reschedule the card to different interval, which
    is randomly assigned between a lower and upper limit that is preset
    by the user (see below).

By default 3 buttons are added, with intervals: "3-4d" , "5-7d" , "8-15d"
    This can be changed below.

I wanted this addon because many of my new cards do not need to be
    "Learned" as I created and added them myself, typically an hour or so before
    my first review session. I often add around 100-200 new cards per day, all on
    a related topic, and this addon allows me to spread the next review of the new
    cards that don't need learning out in time.

How it works: This addon works by intercepting the creation of the reviewer buttons
  and adds up to 4 extra buttons to the review window. The answer function
  is wrapped and the ease parameter is checked to see if it one of the new
  buttons. If it is, the standard answer function is used to add the card
  as an easy card, and then the browser 'reschedCards' function is used
  to reschedule it to the desired interval.

In summary, this functions as if you click the "Easy" button on a new card,
  and then go to the browser and reschedule the card.

Warning: This completely replaces the Reviewer._answerButtons fn, so any changes
   to that function in future updates will be lost. Could ask for a hook?

Support: None. Use at your own risk. If you do find a problem please email me

Setup data
List of dicts, where each item of the list (a dict) is the data for a new button.
This can be edited to suit, but there can not be more than 4 buttons.
    Description ... appears above the button
    Label ... the label of the button
    ShortCut ... the shortcut key for the button
    ReschedMin ... same as the lower number in the Browser's "Edit/Rescedule" command
    ReschedMax ... same as the higher number in the Browser's "Edit/Rescedule" command
