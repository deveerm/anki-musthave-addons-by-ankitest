5 wide big color buttons only with smiles instead of words and a bigger font on them.

Hotkey <i>Escape</i> means LATER NOT NOW both question and answer sides.

Side effect: if you have siblings in queue behind the escaped card — 
you will see them regardless of <i>bury related</i> checkbox.

Hotkey 1 means AGAIN in any case.
Hotkey 2 means HARD when available otherwise it mean GOOD.
Hotkey 3 means GOOD anyway.
Hotkey 4 means maximum available easiness anyhow
 (it is Good for 2 buttons and Easy for 3 or 4 buttons).

<i>Show answer</i> and <i>Again Hard Good Easy</i> buttons are so wide as Anki window.

<i>Good</i> button always takes place of <i>Hard</i> and <i>Easy</i> buttons, 
if they are absent on the card.

They are colored in compatibility with <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1496166067" rel="nofollow">Night Color</a> addon.
