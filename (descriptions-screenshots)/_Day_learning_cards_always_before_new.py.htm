This is a simple monkey patch add-on that inserts day learning cards
 (learning cards with intervals that crossed the day turnover, &gt; 1440 min.)
 always before new cards without depending due reviews. 

By default Anki do so:
  <code>learning; new if before; due; day learning; new if after</code>
With this add-on card will be displayed in the following order:
  <code>learning; (day learning; new) if before; due; (day learning; new) if after</code>

Normally these cards go after due, but I want them to go before new. 

If <code>Tools -&gt; Preferences... -&gt; Basic -&gt; Show new cards before reviews</code>
   learning; day learning; new; due
If <code>Tools -&gt; Preferences... -&gt; Basic -&gt; Show new cards after reviews</code>
   learning; due; day learning; new

  which does so:
   <code>learning; day learning; new if before; due; new if after</code>
